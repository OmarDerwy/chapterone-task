# Chapter One Tech Screen
## React Native Tech Screen: Simple Task Manager App
### Objective:
Develop a basic Task Manager app using React Native. This app will allow
users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The primary focus is on
frontend development, user interaction, and state management within the app.
## Starter Template:
● We recommend using Expo to get started. It will create a basic template for you.
Or you can find another template off github or another resource. -

### Requirements:
#### App Features:
● Add Task: Users can add a new task with a brief description.

● Mark Task as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete, which visually
distinguishes them from incomplete tasks.

● Delete Task: Users can delete a task from the list.

● Task List: Display all tasks in a list view, showing both complete and
incomplete tasks.

#### User Interface:
● Create a clean and intuitive user interface. Use default UI components
provided by React Native, or feel free to use any UI library compatible with
React Native.

● Ensure the app provides visual feedback for user interactions (e.g.,
completing or deleting a task).

#### State Management:

● Use local component state to manage the tasks. This project does not
require external storage or more advanced state management solutions.

● Demonstrate basic understanding of state and props in React Native.

#### Documentation:

Include a README.md file with:

● Instructions for setting up and running the app.

● A brief overview of the app's features and any special instructions
for using it.

● Mention any third-party libraries used and their purpose in your
project.

#### Submission Guidelines:
● Provide a link to a GitHub repository with your project code within 7 days to
eng@startchapterone.com. Ensure the repository is public or can be accessed by
specific reviewers. Alternatively, you can send an email with a .zip file of your
code to eng@startchapterone.com with Title `[Name] - React Native Tech Screen `

● Make sure your code is clean, organized, and commented as necessary.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
● Functionality: Does the app allow users to add, complete, and delete tasks as
described?

● Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, clean, and commented where
necessary?

● UI/UX Design: Is the app's user interface intuitive and responsive? Does it provide
a good user experience?

● Understanding of Core Concepts: Does the app demonstrate a good
understanding of React Native components, state management, and basic user
interactions?
