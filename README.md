Todo list app developed using react native expo

## Get started (2 methods)

### 1 - Download the app

Download the app apk from the releases page on the right

### 2 - Run using emulator or Expo go

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

- expo-blur: provides effect around the "add tasks" modal
- expo-checkbox: provides the checkboxes
- expo-constants: app installation constants inside the code
- expo-font: library that allows loading fonts from the web and using them in the app
- expo-router: file based routing to simplify navigation
- expo-splash-screen: utility to change the splash screen before app opens
